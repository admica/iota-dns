## Features:
* Update your own network name and current IP dynamically and store it in the tangle.
* Dynamically update a DNS server's known domains to bridge iota-dns hosts to traditional DNS.
* Define your own encryption key to allow private DNS hosting for your own set of geographically diverse hosts.
* Use the default public key to add any mapping you want into the public for anyone using iota-dns to find.
